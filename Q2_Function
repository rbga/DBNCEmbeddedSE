2a) So, from looking at column B, everything is a 3 character combination. By calling them x,y,z, we are able to see that
The first character in the output string corresponds to the first character in the input string.
The second character in the output string is determined by the position of the input number in sequence
The second character has a range: 'c', 'm', 'X', 'c', 't', 'P', 'M', 'G', 'v', 'z', 'A', 'Z', 'y', 'T', 'N', 'o', 'd', 'm', 'w', 'n', 'V'.
The third character in the output string seems to depend on the position of the input number relative to a certain threshold value. After which it cycles, before which, it is a constant
The threshold appears to be around 50000.
Above the threshold, the third character cycles through the characters 'g', 'N', 'M', 'K', 'G', 'V', 'y', 'T', 'N', 'm'.
Below the threshold, the third character remains constant as 'c'.

2b)f(30001) = cGp
f(55555) = MUk
f(77788) = ocd

2c) Upper limit is 50000

2d) #include <stdio.h>

char f(int Ai) {
    char characters[] = "cmXctPMGvzAZyTNodmw";
    int threshold = 50000;
    int position = (Ai % 20) + 1;
    
    if (Ai > threshold) {
        return characters[position - 1] + (Ai - threshold) % 10;
    }
    else {
        return characters[position - 1];
    }
}

int main() {
    int input = 15840;
    char result = f(input);
    
    printf("%c\n", result);
    
    return 0;
}
